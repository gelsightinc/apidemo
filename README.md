# GSM Async API 4.3.95.0

### 1/13/2026

A demo application of the GelSight Mobile Async API v4.3.95.0.

## Objective

Describe the GelSight Mobile (GSM) Async API for external software developers.

## Use Cases

The API is developed for two main use cases:

-   Automation 
-   Extension of manual use of GSM

#### Automation

Enable the integration of GSM (GelSight Mobile) into a fully automated workflow where GSM and a GelSight sensor are controlled components in a robotic system. The intended scenario is in-line inspection in a manufacturing setup. Possible other components in the system could be a robot holding the GelSight sensor and maybe another robot that controls a conveyor belt where manufactured parts are inspected and then pushed forward.

From a system perspective, GSM and the sensor are considered components, and not the entity in charge of the manufacturing operation. The Async API is designed with that mindset.

Given that most operations in GSM are orders of magnitude longer than control loop operations like moving a robot and monitoring the move, the chosen service provider methodology is that of an event-based system, where the controlling entity subscribes to relevant events and subsequently orders GSM to start working on completing different tasks, where the success/failure is reported back as events. This methodology has the added benefit of allowing human interaction with the workflow, e.g. allowing a human to press the scan button and then use the event raised at completion of a scan to trigger the next operations managed by the controlling entity.

#### Extension of manual use of GSM

The GSM Async API will raise events to an external app each time an analysis method is completed and saved by GSM. This will be a rich event that contains all outputs and inputs for this analysis method. Reporting this data to an external app enables the application developer to develop custom logic that incorporates the results of multiple scans. It also allows the program logic to take input from other systems such as an ERP/SAP system or other customized workflow software used by the customer.

Some customers may have a desire to automatically forward results generated by GSM into their existing data systems. Prior to the API, this was only possible by manually transferring results from GSM into the customers own system. By writing a simple external app that integrates the GelSight Async DLL, the app will receive events with the results of any analysis. The developer can then easily decide which section of the outputs will be transferred to their own data system, either automatically or via customized UI.

Some customers need to trigger the scan based on their own workflow but perform the analysis inside GSM. This could be using a hardware foot pedal to trigger a scan or maybe some other software system that needs to trigger a scan. Using the API, a single line of code can be written to trigger a scan. It is even possible to instruct GSM what to name the scan and where to store it, e.g. on a shared network drive.

## Environment

The GelSight Async API is delivered as a .NET DLL. The DLL can be linked into multiple programming languages as long as .NET Standard 2.0 or later is installed on the computer. The HelloWorld sample app includes WPF UI. For that to show .NET Framework 4.7.2 or later is needed.

The operating system supported is Microsoft Windows 11. Microsoft Windows 10 is supported until October 14, 2025.

The API requires a licensed GelSight Mobile to be installed.

The API communicates with GelSight Mobile via a TCP socket connection. This means the application developer has the choice of running the custom app with the DLL on the same computer as GSM or on a networked computer.

## Getting Started

To enable API developers a quick and easy start, an open-source Visual Studio sample project has been developed with a “Hello World” application. The Hello World application is only about 300 lines of code that demonstrate all key functions of the API.

The sample is written in C\#, but using simple structures so that non-C\# developers can easily test the behavior and follow the logic.

1.  Install [Visual Studio 2022 Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) and select “.NET desktop development” which enable WPF desktop apps.
2.  Install and license [GelSight Mobile 3.8](https://pages.gelsight.com/latest_release) or later.
3.  Enable the API Server in GSM Configure→System→API.
4.  Download the [GelSight Async API](https://github.com/gelsightinc/apidemo) from the GelSight sdkdemo repo on GitHub.
5.  Load and run the Visual studio project “GelSight.Api.HelloWorld.csproj”.

## Actions

The following actions can be requested by the application developer via the DLL. Details of the parameters and data structures are documented in the sample code.

NOTE: Value types with a ‘?’ are nullable in C\#.

### ScanCompleted Event

The ScanMetaData parameter in the ScanCompleted event contains JSON formatted data from the scan.yaml file located in the newly captured scan’s folder on disk. It is recommended to use the free C\# [Newtonsoft Json.NET library](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json) to help parse this information, but the API developer is free to use any method that they choose.

The JSON string does contain some replication of data.

### AnalysisSaved Event

The Results parameter in the AnalysisSaved event contains JSON formatted data from the scancontext.yaml file located in the subfolder “analysis” inside the captured scan’s folder on disk. It is recommended to use the free C\# [Newtonsoft Json.NET library](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json) to help parse this information, but the API developer is free to use any method that they choose.

The JSON string contains two arrays.

-   [Shapes](#shapes)
-   [Routines](#routines)

The “shapes” contain an entry for each user-created shape drawn on the scan.

The “routines” contain an entry for each analysis method that the user has saved for this scan.

### Shapes

Shapes are defined in a coordinate system that has (0,0) located in the TopLeft corner of a scan.

Each shape has the following shared properties.

### Routines

Some routines will allow the user to draw one or more shapes and use them as input to the routine. If so, those inputs are referred to as shapeid which is referencing the array of “shapes”. One example is offset which requires a user drawn line as the shape input.

Some of the routines create a PNG output file that is rendered on top of the scan for visualization of the results. The filename is an output parameter from the routine, but to avoid overlap with other routines, each routine will get its own subfolder with the following naming convention: \<scan_folder\>/analysis/io_\<routine_id\>. Example is shown below for a scan named “NNK”.
